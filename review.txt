Excellent phone:honest review
  <br/>
  Got it for 9k , +10% discount on sbi,effective price was 8100 bucks which is amazing
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Build: awesome and sturdy
  <br/>
  Performance: it is very beautifully balanced between speed and stability,no app crashes and less load time
  <br/>
  I played dead trigger,asphalt, critical ops with out any lag,
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Battery : is just amazing ,it lasts a say without breaking a sweat
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Heat: it doesn't heat
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Charging time: is 1:50hrs in A.C
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Screen: gr8
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Camera : better than k8 note and is sharper,and faster.colour are so natural and front camera is good
  <br/>
  However macro shots have noice.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jio: no issue highest speed recorded on internet speed meter lite:2.1mbps at some specific areas of my house.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  BIGGEST PRO:   1  is just amazing and if u are music enthusiast like me  and have expensive headphones u can just get lost in music
  <br/>
  2.the size of this phone is so perfect
  <br/>
  <br/>
  BIGGEST CON: front flash is like it is not there,both rear and front flash are out of sync and in low light u can't take pictures,all it captures is a black screen .but I bought this for it's multimedia features and smalls size and battery.

Review after use of 5 days
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Battery-10/10
  <br/>
  Camera-8.5/10
  <br/>
  Display-10/10 (No screen flickering)
  <br/>
  Sound-10/10(Just need one word Dolby Atmos)
  <br/>
  Built Quality-9/10
  <br/>
  It also a VoLte phone
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Now Notification LED light is available with OTA update.....
  <br/>
  Now you can record Slow Motion Video...
  <br/>
  <br/>
  No heating issue noticed till now.
  <br/>
  Depth mood is awesome in this price range.
  <br/>
  And I love the Stock Android experience.
  <br/>
  Only issue is no notification dots on app icon. But search about it at web and it should fix at Oreo(8.0) update.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I noticed some people saying one speaker working out of two they don't no well about it. There one is speaker and other is 2nd noise cancellation and it's designed like speaker for good look.

Review Title : Fabulous mobile phone

Review Content :
Actually I was confused between red me 4 note and Lenovo k8 plus. Some guys suggested me to buy red me 4 note but at last I go with Lenovo k8 plus.
  <br/>
  Why Lenovo k8 plus?
  <br/>
  1) sounds quality is far superior then others phone within this range.
  <br/>
  2) Camera quality is very good and u will not find front 8mp with flash in this range.
  <br/>
  3) Though processor is not Snapdragon but it is ok
  <br/>
  4) display quality is far better.
  <br/>
  5) additional key for music is differentiate among all phones in this range.
  <br/>
  If u r looking for good sound quality phone good camera and display go ahead. And if u are game lover then might be u disappoint.
  <br/>
  Thank you
  <br/>
  If u feel this review is helpful kindly like it.
  <br/>
  All the best..

It's been three months I'm using this phone and i must say I'm really impressed by what i got for just 8100rs. So i would divide it in pros and cons
  <br/>
  Pros -
  <br/>
  1.Cheapest dual camera phone in market
  <br/>
  2.It's not hybrid (you can use memory card with dual Sims)
  <br/>
  3.It has full hd screen(it's not available in smartphones at this price range)
  <br/>
  4.helio p25 processor surprisingly surpasses my expectations, it works flawless never hangs
  <br/>
  5.selfie flash good for night selfies
  <br/>
  6. Finger print is very accurate and really quick
  <br/>
  7. It has single speaker but it's as loud as dual speakers
  <br/>
  Cons -
  <br/>
  1.Slow updates Lenovo sucks at giving update
  <br/>
  2. No fast charger included
  <br/>
  3. No earphone in the box
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>

A good battery phone with awesome sound clarity and HD screen..
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Got this phone for 9000 on B.B.Days
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Looks__ phone looks very premium in hand, you should prefer to choose for venom black colour bcoz that varient looks more premium and classy..
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Screen__ Full HD screen 5.2 inches which is easy to operate and if you love watching movies then your experience will be good due to curved Hd glass
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaker__ this is the best phone I have ever used in terms of sound and speakers.. It's really very loud plus dolby Atmos works really well.  Music key is also very helpful.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Battery last for almost 2 days with no use and 11 hours with constant 4G Jio usage..
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Android is 7.1 and is easy and fluid to operate. Plus you will get Android Oreo update which is a good thing..
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cameras are good but you should not expect any exceptional level of photo experience..
  <br/>
  Depth mode works well but camera clarity is average .
  <br/>
  Front camera is very good so this is good for selfie plus it has selfie flash for night time...
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Overall a good phone at price of 10000.
  <br/>
  <br/>

Review Content :
It's been a week since I am using this awesome thing...I would say I am fully satisfied with the it's performance and worth every penny..
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Camera: Rear camera (13+5 MP) can take some really sharp pictures. Impressed with depth mode pics(takes 2 secs to capture).Front cam(8MP) can take good selfie in low light.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dolby Atmos: With good pair of headphones and HD music you get...lost..mobile loud speaker is just average n has some noise in full volume
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Decent Battery backup: 18hrs of battery backup With 2 hrs of video streaming,1 hr of music,browsing occasionally,connected to 4g all time.No heating issues while charging.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Display is crisp n clear,with nougat the  UI experience is really smooth.Since doesn't have light sensor it's difficult to operate mobile in sunlight.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Performance: Till now didn't noticed any lag while playing games or while using multiple windows(8 to 10). Although 3GB(2.7GB usable) RAM is fair enough  but it's not sufficient if you are a gamer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Storage: only 24GB is available out of 32GB storage.No Facebook,whatsapp,insta etc are pre-installed.Dedicated slot for memory card which supports upto 128GB(finally you are getting rid of hybrid slot).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Finally..if you are looking for good camera phone with great music,decent battery you can just buy it without second thought..

Review Content :
The build quality is good. Metal body and finish feels premium. But if you are going after looks from design perspective it's not for you. It's a bulky and heavy device, check and compare dimensions.
  <br/>
  Applications are running smoothly. I read in articles that it doesn't have FM radio and 3.5mm jack but that is not the case.
  <br/>
  One issue you might find is that it doesn't have inbuilt Gallery app. You have to download an app from playstore, which can have annoying ads.
  <br/>
  Touch is smooth, display quality is not that great but for 11k you can't expect more I guess. You might want to check MI 4 if your friend has one to compare.
  <br/>
  Sharp images are captured with dual camera. But problem is that colors wouldn't be same in images as you see them with your eyes. For example tarquoise became Blue, Red became Pink.
  <br/>
  Overall rating would be 7 out of ten.

Writing this review after 48 hours of using it.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pros
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Screen: It's a full HD screen with beautiful colour saturation, perfect brightness and amazing viewing angles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Battery: My phone initially was dead or of the box, I had to charge it up first to use it. It charged to a full 100 in 2.5 hours... In which, it charged upto 35 in half an hour. I used it mainly for internet and videos, played a few games just to check the graphic performance and after one whole day (24 hours) I was left with 20% battery. It's amazing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Audio: Dolby Atmos. Enough said. You will know if you have a nice pair of headphones.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Graphics: played asphalt 8 for 30 mins without any lag at all.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speed: Didn't do any benchmarks. However, the animation scales, booting up time AND multitasking is smooth as feather.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cons
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Capacitive buttons: the capacitive buttons on the phone are not backlit, niether are customisable.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Heating: it gets a lil heated while charging and continuous gaming. Wasn't an issue for me but can be for people in extreme conditions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Camera: BIGGEST con of the phone. The camera takes fine ish photos in outdoors and in day times, but pathetic indoor photos. The torch is eye blinding bright, and I won't recommend this for phone photographers. Front camera is average.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  No notification light.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There are two grills at the bottom for speakers but only the right one works. It would have been an amazing experience if both of the speakers worked.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Overall the phone is a bang for buck. You can't possibly get better than this at this price point.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheers.

Review Content :
Using this phone from four days.
  <br/>
  I've read some comments before, so now writing this one.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  1. It is a VoLTE device means it enables call directly without turning the internet on. * *(some others are saying that it's not VoLTE. Though the network is showing LTE but that's VoLTE device.)* *
  <br/>
  <br/>
  2. It have notification light, but * *not functioning well,* * if you connect your phone to a charger and turn your phone off, white light can be seen.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  3. Used it for four hour continuously to watch movie, it stays cool. But heating while charging, that's OK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  4. Performance very good. Dolby atoms and FHD display makes HD videos theater like.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  5. Rapid response, never found it running slowly.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  6. Camera is  very good.. * *but it's not a CMOS camera, so not provides Clearer photos at night.* * But best ever pics by day. *Debth sensor can take best pics by day.*
  <br/>
  <br/>
  7. * *Late focusing in rear camera.* *
  <br/>
  <br/>
  8. Battery is amazing, A whole day performance using videos, gaming and much more.. takes 3hr approx. to charge from 1% to 100%.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  9. You can use all three at a time, two sim cards and one memory card.(in redmi only two can be used at a time).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  10. Using it without screen protector, doesn't need and screen protector, it is gorilla glass 3, very hard (screen protector recommend for advanced safety) no fingerprints on screen because oleophobic coating.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  11. * *Memory card is not functioning properly. I'm using a SAMSUNG EVO CLASS 10 32GB. Sometimes a notification shows external SD card is missing, I also replaced it with a 2 GB card, that I have, same problem.* *
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Note: Box does not contain earphone or back cover.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That's all..

People who say Depth mode is not good:
  <br/>
  The depth mode is currently under beta version, hopefully the next update will roll out with the fully ready depth mode camera.
  <br/>
  From my personal use, the camera is working great for this price range.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  People who say VoLTE is not working:
  <br/>
  Put your jio Sim in slot number 1 it will work. Too bad you don't know that Jio Sim works only in slot number 1.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  People about heating issue:
  <br/>
  I kept my mobile in charge until it reached full charge, I experienced no heat issue. (It was in charge for more than an hour).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There is nothing wrong with the device, it is the best for this price range. Redmi Note 4 can't compete with this, I guarantee you that.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Can thoroughly rely on this mobile, without any fear. There is no negative in this mobile.

I had ordered for K8 plus . The set i had received  had a network problem . signal strength is always showing minimum on display.
  <br/>
  subsequently  i had requested for replacement  and set was replaced by flipkart , but same problem is there with new set also. I think product has some manufacturing defect in software etc. I had changed sim also but still no use. while the same sim is showing full strength in other handsets.
  <br/>
  Not sure what to do now.

Bought at Rs 10999 on day 1, now available at 8999, within 10 days. :(
  <br/>
  Phone is nice.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pros:
  <br/>
  Good battery life.  Last for one and half day for me. From 100 to 5 It was around 32 hours. During this I used it for calling, music and mostly as hotspot about 15 hours. It was still running and I was like wawww
  <br/>
  Display is also good.
  <br/>
  Dedicated music key
  <br/>
  Front flash
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cons :
  <br/>
  Rear camera is not that much good as the claim. Took too long to process Depth enabled images and still images lack details and don't have that depth mode effect . Looks like software twik. Normal images are good.

My full review : ( update : volte is working perfectly in both sum slots !!)
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Over all a great device for the price !! But mixed views many pros and some cons
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I bought it in BBD for below 10k !! It's a great deal for that price !! No complaints !!
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pros :
  <br/>
  0: Better signal reception and no call drops !!
  <br/>
  1. Better build quality than redmi devices ( I personally have one so )
  <br/>
  2. Corning gorilla glass 3
  <br/>
  3. Dual cam ( performance is ok for the price I paid )
  <br/>
  4. Good performance for medium to high users ( multitasking is just awesome) (Dono about intensive gaming)
  <br/>
  5. Super fast fingerprint scanner ( Better faster and accurate than my RN3 )
  <br/>
  6. Great Battery Life ( 3.15 hrs of sot with 35% battery use)(mixed use on 4G/wifi and lil gaming)
  <br/>
  7. GOOD Speaker quality !!! ( Speaker out put is very much satisfactory )( 7/10)
  <br/>
  8: Good Display Quality Better than redmi phones I'm damn sure about it !!
  <br/>
  9: assured Oreo Update !!
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cons :
  <br/>
  1: more internal memory is consumed by OS !! 8 GB is consumed by OS very bad !! (UPDATE : 23.9GB is available for user space so good to go !! )
  <br/>
  2: no led notification light (Update : it is present in between camera and sensor but not usable stupid Moto policy and no Moto display too Maybe provided in future update)
  <br/>
  3: Many blaotware around 8 apps all are Microsoft apps and true caller and Skype but can be disabled everything !!  And 2 Lenovo apps they can be disabled and muted !!
  <br/>
  4: headphone audio quality is not so great (midocre output seriously)
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nutral :
  <br/>
  Call quality is good !! Both mic and speaker quality !! But opposite side people say voice is not identifiable I mean not identifiable but Cristal clear !! They can't identify you easily
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That's it overall it's a great phone for under 10 k but not worthy for 11K and above seriously !!
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Initial Impressions
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Looks :
  <br/>
  It looks sturdy but dono wether it will survive some occasional drops it has Corning gorilla glass in front and the back is slippery like anything so buy a case immediately !! And lil heavy in hands but 4000 mAh battery and metal casing no complaints !! And the phone matches the size of my redmi note 3 !! Even though it's a 5.2 inch screen cud nee becoz of dual cam setup and non hybrid slot !! Kudos Lenovo for that stuff !!
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Performance :
  <br/>
  Even though it's a mediatek CPU its just super cool with continuous usage of one to two hours with half brightness and auto brightness on  and 4G connectivity volte enabled which covers a bunch of apps download too
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The phone gets lil warm but you can't hardly notice it ! Very less not noticable !!
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ui :
  <br/>
  UI is pure stock Android raw aosp with some minor tweaks it gives micro lag experience some times shud be UI fault !! Again it won't be a big issues just micron second !! Other than that it's fluid smooth and handles better all apps no Force closes !! I played some basic games great experience no lags and no over heating checked with CPZ , temperature maintained within 40 degrees after 40 minutes of play all mediocre games with medium brightness and auto brightness on and 4G on
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Camera :
  <br/>
  I'm not a pro potographer !! For the camera does great in good light conditions and decent in indoor light conditions and noisy in low light conditions !! So obviously budget camera performance !!
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That's it guys !! Hope my review is helpfull but sorry for long discription !!
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Regards
  <br/>

Pro :
  <br/>
  1)Just received an update of 83mb thats fix screen flikring issue , and camera issue. Slow motion video is added., LED notification is on.
  <br/>
  2) no heating
  <br/>
  3) battery backup is simple awesome
  <br/>
  4) camera performance also good,
  <br/>
  5) speaker is loud
  <br/>
  6) screen is very sharp and olephobic coating makes the screen very smooth in touch . Just like premium touch
  <br/>
  7) two sim plus memory card.
  <br/>
  8) extra customisable music key
  <br/>
  9) while it is mediatake p25 proceser it can easily beat snapdragon 430 or 450 . Gaming is just lag free. From last 7 days i was playing Asphalt 8. No problem found.
  <br/>
  10) pure Android experience and lenovo promise the oreo update in 2018 starting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cons:
  <br/>
  1) LED notification light is present.but it can't be activated.
  <br/>
  2) no backlight on front button
  <br/>
  3) in bokhe effect the edges are not sharp
  <br/>
  4) yello photos in dark by using flash.
  <br/>
  5) front flash is not good in dark.
  <br/>
  6) ram management is not as much as good . Out of 3 gb only 1.2 gb approx. free
  <br/>
  7) 2A charger. Not fast charging. Full charging takes more than 2 hours.
  <br/>
  8) not fully metallic. Upper and lower antina band are made of plastic.only middle back is metal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Final verdict :
  <br/>
  I bought it in price 9k under offer. So under 10k it is the best one.  i dont buy redmi note 4 bcoz this has better camera experience. Dont be confused by other reviews. Lenovo provi the update. And now this phone working perfectly. Go with it frndz.

Dear flipkart nd flipkart customers,
  <br/>
  I have placed order to the store INDIFLASHMART for LENOVO K8+ smart phone on September 8th. I received my product on September 11th. When I used my phone in dimlight for the first time with the Adaptive brightness option, I noticed heavy flickering on the display. Then I unchecked the Adaptive brightness option and kept the brightness to the minimum and checked the display, it was flickering continuously. But with brightness as maximum, the display was without any flickering. So to find the reason for this defect, I contacted Lenovo technician through chat through their native site. They suggested to restart the phone and use the phone in safe mode or perform factory reset. I tried both the option but still the defect was not resolved. So I decided to ask for replacement to the seller INDIFLASHMART on September 14 for the above mentioned defect . But I received a mail saying that my request was rejected and they gave the following reply -
  <br/>
  <br/>
  ""We are sorry to hear that you are facing a problem in the display for the above mentioned product.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  We request you to follow these simple steps that?ll help to fix your issue.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Drag down the status bar
  <br/>
  Move the Brightness slider
  <br/>
  OR
  <br/>
  Tap Menu
  <br/>
  Go to Settings
  <br/>
  Select Display
  <br/>
  Tap Brightness Level
  <br/>
  Move the Brightness slider
  <br/>
  If required, turn OFF Adaptive Brightness ""
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Is this the way ur sellers respond to ur customers????? The fault is with the phone's display and I was asked to adjust this defect with the settings...
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I have purchased nearly 5 to 7 phones from ur site. But this is the first time I am facing the problem like this. I am completely taken back by the irresponsible answer from the seller....

Review Title : Power packed smartphone out there!!

Upvotes : 14

Downvotes : 3

Review Content :
Okay so let me tell you why I think this is the best smartphone for this price range..
  <br/>
  <br/>
   Processor and clock speed :
  <br/>
  If you are gadget geek like me than you will probably know how important these terms are when it comes to performance.This one comes with a mediatek processor which is not as good as compared to the Qualcomm Snapdragon but still it's pretty good..only difference is this phone is designed to reload the games if you have them in background and other phones may resume the game(doesn't mean processor is good ) but still I found this little irritating during gaming...rest assured the phone works pretty good and can handle almost any app or game for that matter..
  <br/>
  <br/>
   Camera : DONT EXPECT GOOD CAMERA HERE.. although it has 13+5 in the back but I am not sure if the second camera does anything..photos are not good in low light conditions and colour perception is poor.. Overall not a phone for you if you are a camera guy
  <br/>
  <br/>
   Music: yes this phone has Dolby Atmos..the audio through the headphones are crisp and tuned to your preference..I use Sennheiser cx180 in ear phones and this combination is deadly ...I spend hours every day listening to songs and so will you...360 audio clearance is totally awesome..also it as a music key that is basically for playing music but you can program it for a bunch of other things..
  <br/>
  <br/>
   O.S : this phone runs stock Android Nougat which means it comes without any skins and also promised update to Oreo(don't know when that is going to happen). multitasking is precise.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  *Okay so these are the things I look into before purchasing a phone..I got this one for 9k so no complaints at all.. overall the phone is really good and personally I found this phone better than redmi note 4..
  <br/>
  Hope this helps..and if you find this informative, please give it a thumps up..

Review Title : Lenovo Launched This Phone Without Proper Testing

Upvotes : 102

Downvotes : 52

Review Content :
Guys,
  <br/>
  Dont go for the positive reviews, i did same and made a mistake.
  <br/>
  firstly i replaced the phone,  appreciate flipkart for thier 1 time replacement!!!!
  <br/>
  but all the problems are still same on the replaced phone too
  <br/>
  m writing this review after 3 weeks heavy usageon
  <br/>
  The outcomes are:
  <br/>
  -the phone has several issues, may be lenovo launched this phone without proper testing
  <br/>
  -there are many threads discussions on internet you must check, like youtube lenovo community etc, search for lenovo k8 plus issue
  <br/>
  -when your phone is charged above 60%, and you put brightness to the lowest level, the screen start flickring/blinking simultaneously which is very irrirating for eyes.
  <br/>
  -when you capture images in dark with flash on it captures extremely yellow images, you can check samples available everywhere on internet.
  <br/>
  -camera capture speed is very slow, its takes about 2-3 sec to capture a single photo
  <br/>
  -lenovo say the phone comes with stock android, but its not a stock android, its only looks like a stock android, there are lots of blotware apps which you cant uninstall like useless and heavy storage microsoft apps.
  <br/>
  -while gaming, sometimes the phone gets heatup to 45 degrees
  <br/>
  -very less user space available out of 32 gb, more than 2 gb ram is used, even when you make a first boot. 700-800 mb free ram available there.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  rest all features are good, its a perfect multimedia phone with theater max dolby sound and blah blah...
  <br/>
  The question is.. why you invest your money in a phone which comes with lots of defects, maybe lenovo will fix all these bugs after that you can surely go for this product.

Review Title : One of the Best in the market

Review Content :
Worth every penny you have spent on it..... Writing this review after one week of usage....
  <br/>
  <br/>
  1 . One of the best camera in it's prize range ....far better than redmi 4 and redmi note 4 ...... And one more thing to mention over here is sometimes it takes pictures like Dslr and Video quality at night with flash is just awesome
  <br/>
  2 . Full HD Display at 424 ppi pixel density is top among it's class that too with gorilla. Glass protection..... redmi note 4 doesn't even stand nearby this mobile
  <br/>
  3 . Dolby Atmos sound quality you won't believe untill you use it .... It makes enen cheap headphones sound well by Dolby sound enhancement technology
  <br/>
  4 . Gaming is also at Par ..... You can play High end games where you may find few frame drops ...... But come on you have got almost 98% of all the specs which is not even available in some High end costly phones .....
  <br/>
  5 . Theatre max experience is inbuilt in this mobile and it has got almost all the sensors  to make the experience much better but for that you need to buy good quality Vr headsets available at around 700 with remote in Flipkart only
  <br/>
  6 . Battery don't even worry for it takes all your work load for approx 1.5 days in a single charge
  <br/>
  7 . Dual SIM is the best you can use two nano Sims and a dedicated micro sd card slot..... Which is not available in redmi 4 and redmi note 4....
  <br/>
  8 . Touch experience is also the best in this prize range .......
  <br/>
  9 . Looks Very much Premium due to 2.5d curved screen .......
  <br/>
  10 . Tough and rugged won't break so easily you can check out Videos in YouTube ..... Like redmi note 4 screen broken in a single drop that too from waist height
  <br/>
  Close your eyes and go for it ...... You won't regret a single penny spent on it .....
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mark my words redmi note 4 and redmi 4 are not even comparable with Lenovos  K8 Plus in terms of Camera , Screen , Sound , Gaming , Virtual reality Toughness And overall Mobile experience.

I am using it from last 3 days. The battery performance is superb and overall other features are also good.
  <br/>
  One major issue however is the "Cast" function  is not working. It is disappointing. They must release patch for it.

Review Content :
Well it's a pretty decent phone, screen is good, excellent vibrant colours, 5.2 inch full hd screen very handy, gripy and comfortable to use, dual camera do their work bokeh effects are good, fhd recording, so does the front facing camera. And it comes with stock Android nougat 7.1.1 which is a plus point which makes the user interface very smooth and fluid, and the last but not the least it's got a media tek helio 2.5Ghz processor I would have preferred a Qualcomm Snapdragon 600 series chipset, that's the only minus point in it but it's a really good phone.. would recommend to go it..
